# Voice-Assistant
This Python script is a basic voice assistant that performs several useful tasks through voice commands. The assistant listens to the user via the microphone, processes the voice input, and responds with appropriate actions using text-to-speech. Here are the main functionalities:

Text-to-Speech: The assistant uses pyttsx3 to convert text responses into speech, making the assistant interactive and user-friendly.
Voice Command Recognition: With speech_recognition, the assistant listens for commands from the user and converts the audio into text for processing.
Current Time: The assistant can provide the current time when the user asks for it.
Current Date: It can also announce the current date when prompted.
Wikipedia Search: The assistant can search Wikipedia and summarize relevant information on a given topic.
Play Music: Using pywhatkit, it can play a song or video on YouTube based on user requests.
Exit Command: When the user says "stop," the assistant will say goodbye and stop listening.
The script provides a simple interface for voice interaction, making it a good starting point for building a personal virtual assistant in Python.
